# Commit-Classification-by-Maintenance-Activities

Here you can find the replication of multi-label commit classification.

To run the code and see relevant datasets follow the [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/xovotat/commit-classification-by-maintenance-activities/notebook?scriptVersionId=143398141)

Mind that you do not need to train the model yourself. To avoid this, use the already trained _saved_model_ from Output Files.
